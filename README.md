# Detection-of-MT
I tried to detect MT from a fluctuation movie.

Please make directories as follows:

media/image/1_original/

media/image/2_gray/

media/image/3_binary/

media/image/4_bgsub/

media/video/

Please put the directory "media" in the same directory as "main.py".

Please put a movie in "video" and a template image in "image".
(The size of a the movie was too big to upload to github...)

Please rewrite the pathname in "main.py".

It is a trial phase so precision is too bad (20201210).
